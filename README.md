Sorry for how long this has taken for me to upload x3

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I highly recommend using ***[AltSnap](https://github.com/RamonUnch/AltSnap)*** to be able to move your terminal around after applying my config, unless you already use something like Komorebi or GlazeWM. <br><br>
> To access the settings on your terminal after applying my config, do `Win + Shift + P` to open the command palette and just type settings. <br><br>
> To enable the titlebar, type *'focus'* in the ***command palette*** and click the `toggle focus mode` button.<br><br>
> These configs include fonts such as ***JetbrainsMono Nerd Font*** which is needed in YASB, Windows Terminal and Discord. <br><br>
> I do highly also recommend using the ***latest version of Powershell*** (you can download by using `winget install Powershell` in your terminal)

> [!NOTE]
> Some of these configs are modified versions of already existing configs, such as YASB, oh-my-posh, and Spicetify. <br>

# Requirements


## Windows Terminal

##### READ THE IMPORTANT NOTE AT THE TOP OF THIS README <br>
<img width="700" alt="{492E9617-732F-4E98-954E-936BFF40586F}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e83ef265-19de-4bc2-9ae2-420893ab3d61" />

Copy the code from https://github.com/Hi-doki/senkotheme/blob/main/windowsTerminal/settings.json and replace it into your Windows Terminal settings JSON file located at `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\settings.json`

## Fastfetch
<img width="700" alt="{37AB2789-A2CE-432F-93CF-2E8CADE32CBB}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4ea7cc8-c0dd-4f16-8276-f2c0a2ceb1b3" />

Copy both of the files inside of https://github.com/Hi-doki/senkotheme/tree/main/fastfetch and paste them into `C:\Users\USERNAME\.config\fastfetch`.

## **<sub><sup>Winfetch (Slower than Fastfetch, not recommended)</sup></sub>**

  ### <sub><sup>Copy code from https://github.com/Hi-doki/senkotheme/blob/main/winfetch/config.ps1 and paste into `C:\Users\USERNAME\.config\winfetch\config.ps1`</sup></sub>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## YASB
<img width="1920" alt="{48329DC2-5D2F-4DFB-BFB2-DB3675E4DE1A}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45cada3b-67fa-4302-99a1-1e725a9d1871" />

Copy both the `config.yaml` and `styles.css` from https://github.com/Hi-doki/senkotheme/tree/main/yasb and replace the files from `C:\Users\USERNAME\.config\yasb` with the new files. (Make sure you backup your original config just incase :3)

## VSCode
<img width="700" alt="{06807C65-7ACE-40CC-9057-CEDE6F069C8B}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bc7e3d8-bb6d-4760-9a7c-39ab5b2721fb" />

I have made the VSCode theme an extension which you can download from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Michii.senkorange or type in `Senkorange` on VSCode to download.

## Spicetify
<img width="700" alt="{F65CC627-E2DB-4905-AB3E-321BFD6F1EE6}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf5dd320-2160-4bc1-9f85-19b16ad2dd20" />

Download the `text` folder by using this url: https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/Hi-doki/senkotheme/tree/main/spicetify/ and place the `text` folder into `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\spicetify\Themes`.
Edit the `config-xpui.ini` in spicetify's main folder so that `current_theme` is set to `text` and `color_scheme` is set to `SenkoSan`.
After that just type in your console `spicetify apply` and everything should work ^^

## Oh-my-posh
<img width="700" alt="{12A5AF7E-F985-40B5-A2A5-7302B618EC1C}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f19c214-3b53-4dd0-a419-5ee1f3472ad4" />

Create a folder in `C:\Users\USERNAME\.config` called `oh-my-posh`, download https://github.com/Hi-doki/senkotheme/blob/main/oh-my-posh/SenkoSan.json and move it over to that newly created folder.

## Discord
<img width="700" alt="{903C510A-3460-451C-ADB3-264B751BE1B0}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0747ba5b-fc4f-4c41-ab94-4493cc6fc142" /> <br>
#### USING VENCORD:

Download the css file from https://github.com/Hi-doki/senkotheme/blob/main/discord/senkotheme.theme.css and place it into `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Vencord\themes`. Then go over to Discord's settings, Themes, and enable senkotheme. <br>
Alternatively, you can copy the url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hi-doki/senkotheme/refs/heads/main/discord/senkotheme.theme.css and paste into the `Online Themes` section of the Themes tab in Vencord.



## How to setup Powershell to use oh-my-posh and Fastfetch
On your terminal, type in the command `notepad $PROFILE`, this will most likely bring a popup on your screen that it will create the file for you. Once you are on the config file `Microsoft.Powershell_profile.ps1`, copy the code from https://github.com/Hi-doki/senkotheme/blob/main/PowerShell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 and paste it in, then save. 
**==(Make sure to change the username in the code as I left my account's username in it)==**

*If you have any problems with getting the configs to work, please create an issue on the GitHub repository or just DM me on discord (mi.\_.chiii)*
